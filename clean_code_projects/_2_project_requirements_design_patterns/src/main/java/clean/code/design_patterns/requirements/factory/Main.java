########################################## Definition ###########################################################
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass,
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

########################################## Problem ##########################################################
Imagine that youâ€™re creating a logistics management application. The first version of your app can only handle transportation by trucks, so the bulk of your code lives inside the Truck class.
After a while, your app becomes pretty popular. Each day you receive dozens of requests from sea transportation companies to incorporate sea logistics into the app. At present, most of your
code is coupled to the Truck class. Adding Ships into the app would require making changes to the entire codebase. Moreover, if later you decide to add another type of transportation to the app, you will probably need to make all of these changes again.
This can be also applied to creating cross-platform GUI elements.

######################################### Solution ##########################################################
The solution is to create a special method, I called it configure(). This method can take a parameter that specifies what type of object should be created (Truck, Ship, etc.)

public class Main {

    static void configure() {
        if (System.getProperty("os.name").equals("Windows 10")) {
            dialog = new WindowsDialog();
        } else {
            dialog = new HtmlDialog();
        }
    }

    static void runBusinessLogic() {
        dialog.displayPanel();
    }
}
